#+TITLE: iotools-tls13.hy

Pure Python implementation of client side TLS1.3 protocol for iotools.

Unsupported features:

- Renegotiation: HRR (Hello Retry Request), it's stupid.
- Complex server verfication: just verify server certificate chian and
  signature, ignore more complex mechanism such as status request.
- Client verification: CR (Certificate Request) and PHA (Post
  Handshake Auth), do it on application layer.
- Limited PSK mechanism: currently only support one PSK with
  PSK-DHE-KE mode, and when use PSK, assert only one cipher suite was
  specified.
